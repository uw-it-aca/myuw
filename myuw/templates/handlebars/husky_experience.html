                            <p>We are a team of UW staff members who care about your success. We want to help you create the kind of Husky Experience that will serve you best. To do this, we gathered and curated advice from students, faculty, and staff from across UW on how to make the most of your time here.</p>
                            <p>The toolkit was curated by Michaelann Jundt of Undergraduate Academic Affairs, Janice Fournier and William Washington of UW Information Technology and Katy DeRosier from the Office of the Provost.</p>

                            <h3 class="myuw-heading-page">How it works</h3>
                            <p>These articles are delivered here via MyUW so that all students have access to these ideas and resources. New articles are highlighted each week on the home page to provide timely advice, but read and explore them anytime.</p>
                            <p>We plan to add new articles and resources each academic year.</p>
