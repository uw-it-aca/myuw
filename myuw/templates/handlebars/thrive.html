<p>This toolkit is one of many efforts of the Husky Experience—an initiative designed to help all students opt in to the kinds of experiences that comprise a vital and well-rounded 21st century education. Its focus is on the broad skills, knowledge, and abilities gained through classroom learning, as well as through high impact experiences such as study abroad, jobs and internships, research and leadership projects, and participation in clubs and community organizations. <a href="http://www.washington.edu/strategicplanning/initiatives/husky-experience/" data-linklabel="Learn about Husky Experience">Learn more about the Husky Experience</a>.</p>
